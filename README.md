# FreezingAnimation
To illustrate freezing an animation at the CALayer level, let’s explore the animatable path property of a CAShapeLayer. Consider a layer that can display a rectangle or an ellipse or any of the intermediate shapes between them. I can’t imagine what the notion of an intermediate shape between a rectangle or an ellipse may mean, let alone how to draw such an intermediate shape; but thanks to frozen animations, I don’t have to.
